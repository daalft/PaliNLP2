Pali Natural Language Processing - Morphological Analyzer and Generator

PaliNLP is a system that provides morphological tools for Pali.

The presented system is a first step in the direction of the morphological analysis of Pali. The system is already functional, proving the concept to be viable and promising. There is still some fine-tuning than can and should be done to improve this system, especially in the area of irregular declensions. Nonetheless, the system at the current stage of development should be able to process the majority of Pali words.
